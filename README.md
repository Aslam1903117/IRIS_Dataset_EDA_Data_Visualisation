# Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset. The project utilizes Python and several libraries to visualize and understand the relationships between the features of the dataset.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to explore and visualize the Iris dataset by performing the following tasks:

1. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to understand the relationships between features.
2. **Feature Exploration**: Analyze the distribution and correlation of features across different species.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Generate a correlation matrix to examine feature relationships.
4. **Distribution Analysis**: Use histograms and KDE plots to explore feature distributions.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Seaborn**: For creating statistical graphics.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualization.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
